### Fun Facts

A quote by Mike Tyson I have on a poster on my bedroom wall is:
> Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face.

My favorite programming language is C++ because I am most comfortable with it, as most of my classes so far have been taught in C++.

```
#include <iostream>
cout << "Looking forward to a great quarter!" << endl;
```

My cousin recently got a dog. Her name is Mia and she's a five month old labradoodle. Here is a picture of her just for smiles:)
