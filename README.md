# CSE110-Lab1

Note: My task list appears regularly on GitHub but has extra bullet points on GitHub Pages. I spoke to a tutor and tried changes but this seems to be a problem with GitHub Pages.

Note: My .gitignore was not working until after the last step when I got help from a tutor - it worked in the branch Added-.gitignore where I updated the .gitignore and PRIVATE.txt was not pushed.
