# CSE110-Lab1

Note: My task list appears regularly on GitHub but has extra bullet points on GitHub Pages. I spoke to a tutor and tried changes but this seems to be a problem with GitHub Pages.

Note: I had to go back and redo the .gitignore part at the end from the command line because it was not working earlier. I included both the initial commit from VS Code and the later changes on the command line to get the .gitignore working as screenshots.
